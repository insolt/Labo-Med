# Labo-Med
Labo-Med's web site created in 2009

My first ever web site project. It has been done in 2009 and was a "comercial" web site for my aunt's medical company in Poznan/Poland.
I managed to create it after reading the only book "Styling with CSS" by Charle sWyke-Smith. 
Photos have been taken by my great friend with an artist soul - Jacek Cwiok
